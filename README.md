Test Project as a task

This is a todo list application with just some angular material components

Depending on the version of angular installed we need to run

npm install --legacy-peer-deps

We can:
  - Create a todo
  - Delete a todo
  - Update a todo text
  - Update the done status
  - Use Drag and drop to adjust the position of the todo in the list
  - Persist the todos in the local storage and read on reload


Improvements:
  - A better visual design
  - better theming
  - More information about the todo?
  - Accessibility testing
  - Test cases
